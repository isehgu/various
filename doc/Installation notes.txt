Robot Master/Remote Server
1.       Map the FTP drive:
a.       net use * \\ix-ftp01.inf.ise.com\eftroot /user:prod\{your Test domain username}
 
2.       Map the J drive:
a.       net use j: \\office.iseoptions.com\iseusersroot\ise_shared
 
3.       Create a checkout of the Robot files in SVN:
a.       http://v-db-svn01/svn/repos/ISE/ASGScripts/TestAutomation/trunk/RobotFramework
 
4.       Install Python and Python Modules:
a.       J:\ASG\RobotFramework\Installation_Files\python-2.6.4.msi
b.      J:\ASG\RobotFramework\Installation_Files\MySQL-python-1.2.4.win32-py2.6.exe
c.       J:\ASG\RobotFramework\Installation_Files\lxml-2.3.win32-py2.6.exe
 
5.       Add python to PATH environment variable so that ‘python’ and ‘pybot’ can be called from any directory.
a.       Right-Click 'My Computer' -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced Tab ->
Environment Variables -> Path -> Edit... -> To the end of Variable value, add:
C:\Python26; (or where ever Python is installed)
C:\Python26\Scripts; (for pybot)
 
6.       Create a new PYTHONPATH system environment variable so that all of the Robot python files and modules are visible to your python installation.
a.       Right-Click 'My Computer' -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced Tab ->
Environment Variables -> New... (under System variables) ->
Variable Name: PYTHONPATH
Variable Value: <YOUR-SVN-CHECKOUT> (top of robot directory)


Robot Master 
7.       Install Robot
a.       J:\ASG\RobotFramework\Installation_Files\robotframework-2.8.1.win32.exe
b.      Test the installation by running 'pybot --help' from the cmd prompt

Robot Remote Server
7.       Run Robot Remote Server
a.       Find the Windows Batch File that will launch Robot Remote Server and double click that batch file -- <svn checkout folder>/ASGLibrary/start_ASGLibrary_server.bat
--------------------------------------------
To run robot test locally --
1. In TSV's library, you would need to set it to 
 ASGLibrary.ASGLibrary.ASGLibrary
We don't run it as remote server, because if it's remote server, robot will take a long time to connect to it, and get all the libraries imported.

2. To run test, from the test folder --
python smart_pybot.py -s Dummyhan
Keep in mind, smart_pybot would search all folder under /RobotFramework/Tests, and pattern match anything that matches Dummyhan and run that test. This pattern match is NOT case-sensitive.

----------
To run robot test remotely--
Step
1. Run <svn checkout folder>/ASGLibrary/start_ASGLibrary_server.bat

2. In TSV's library, you would need to set it to 
Library           Remote    tc-pat211.test.ise.com:${PORT}    WITH NAME    tc-pat211

3. Any keyword should be preceeded with the hostname, since we don't know which remote server has that keyword. 
tc-pat211.sendOrder

Question -- what happens if keyword doesn't have server name?

4. To run test, from the master server's test folder
python smart_pybot.py -s <test name>
